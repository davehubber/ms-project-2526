QUICK START: Running Simulation Models & Optimizations
======================================================

For detailed installation instructions, data preparation, and full replication steps, 
please refer to the README.md file in this repository.

1. SETUP
--------
- Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed.
- Ensure SUMO is installed and added to your PATH.
- Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

2. RUNNING OPTIMIZATIONS (OD ESTIMATION)
----------------------------------------
To estimate the OD matrix using the pre-trained metamodel:

A. SPSA Algorithm (Stochastic):
   python scripts/run_spsa.py

B. M-SPSA Algorithm (Gradient-Based):
   python scripts/run_mspsa.py

Output CSVs and convergence plots will be saved in the `results/` folder.

3. TESTING THE MODEL
--------------------
To train the metamodel and see evaluation metrics (test loss, reality gap plots):

   python scripts/train_metamodel.py

Plots will be saved to `results/`.
